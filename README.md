utlite
======

A lightweight assertion based unit test framework for C++.

This is a header only simple unit test framework that can be used with any C++ project. If a C project is using a C++
compiler, then this framework can be easily incorporated inside it. It has the below features:

1. Fast and lightweight.
2. Uses standard/modern C++.
3. No bloat of infinite classes with peculiar names (ala Java :P).
4. Easy to implement and looks similar to CPPUNIT (but a lot simpler).
5. Header-only, so no linking/building nightmare.
6. Published under LGPL.
7. Future versions will support logging (um, not a feature though).

For an example on how to use it, see testutlite.cc.
